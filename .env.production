# Production Environment for ontru.in
# Vite reads this file when NODE_ENV=production or running "npm run build"

# STRATEGY CHANGE: Use app.ontru.in to ensure Same-Origin requests (Bypasses CORS issues)
# Since Nginx serves both ontru.in and app.ontru.in with the same rules, 
# querying the API on app.ontru.in works perfectly and is faster/safer.
